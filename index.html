                <p>
                    I am currently a Data Analyst working at the Waste Resource Action Plan (WRAP). Previously I have
                    completed a PhD in Food and Nutritional Sciences and worked in various Research and Development
                    roles within the food industry. My interests interesect AI and the food industry.

                    My PhD was in Food and Nutritional Sciences, and my project was focussed around on-pack dates: how
                    they contribute to waste and how they could be improved. Generally speaking, I had a very broad
                    project covering biology, chemistry, microbiology and quite a lot of coding.
